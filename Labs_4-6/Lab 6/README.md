# Lab 6: Temperature Data Acquisition System

This lab implements a temperature data acquisition system. The system uses a Python script to read temperature data and log it to a CSV file.

## Components

*   **`Data-logs-and-code/`**: This directory contains the Python script for data acquisition and the resulting data logs.
    *   `temperature_daq.py`: The Python script used to read and log temperature data.
    *   `*.csv`: CSV files containing the logged temperature data.
*   **`Graphs/`**: This directory contains graphs generated from the logged data, showing the temperature over time.
*   **`Report/`**: This directory contains the lab report in PDF format.
*   **`VI-diagram-and-flowchart/`**: This directory contains a PDF with a diagram of the virtual instrument (VI) and a flowchart of the system's logic.
